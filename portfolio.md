>Earth's Light is a cooperative action-adventure game following the story of four animals and their journey to save their ecosystems, protect their homes, and heal the planet. Fight off garbage monsters plaguing the wetlands, the invasive plants enrapturing the forest, water spirits flooding the plains, and the mechanical chipper robots destroying the arctic.

A project in collaboration with the Toronto Zoo as a member of Sedna Games, a group of students from Ontario Tech University. Features two complete levels (Wetlands and Arctic) and functions as a prototype proof of design developed over a year (09/2020 ~ 09/2021).

Over the course of the project, our group of seven collaborated over Discord and planned our timeline using Jira. We would undergo daily scrums to check for progress on our weekly tasks, and hold a larger meeting every week to assign new tasks and deal with merging on our repository hosted on Github (using Github Desktop). Every week our project lead would meet with a member on the Toronto Zoo team to convey our progress as well as receive feedback on elements they may wish to see within the game.

As the gameplay programmer of this project, I handled most of the front-end programming related to gameplay and dealt with some user interface elements. Here are some elements I programmed:
- Movement (Jumping/Double Jumping, Dashing/Air Dashing, Basic Movement)
- Combat (Light/Heavy Attacks and Combos, Ground Slam, Combat Abilities, Death, Revive, Damage Calculations, Character Swapping)
- Quick Time Events (Button Mash, Circular Button Rotations, Sequential Button Input, Time Sensitive Input)
- Camera (Third Person Camera, Cinematic Shots, Splitscreen, Cinemachine)
- Pickups (Health, Datapads)
- Enemy AI - Wetlands (Flinger, Splitter, Trashzilla, Flying Trash Bug, Trashmon)
- Local Lobby (Joining/Disconnecting Controllers)
Besides these things, I also implemented the UI related to player portraits, health bar, combat skill icons and cooldown, text pop-up when picking up datapads, and character swap wheel UI. Furthermore, I implemented the character and Wetland enemy models and animations into the game, hooking them up so that they work in game and dabbled in visual effects/post processing using Unity's shader graphs to enhance the graphics of the game.
