>Earth's Light is a cooperative action-adventure game following the story of four animals and their journey to save their ecosystems, protect their homes, and heal the planet. Fight off garbage monsters plaguing the wetlands, the invasive plants enrapturing the forest, water spirits flooding the plains, and the mechanical chipper robots destroying the arctic.

A project in collaboration with the Toronto Zoo as a member of Sedna Games, a group of students from Ontario Tech University. Features two complete levels (Wetlands and Arctic) and functions as a prototype proof of design developed over a year (09/2020 ~ 09/2021).

Over the course of the project, our group of seven collaborated over Discord and planned our timeline using Jira. We would undergo daily scrums to check for progress on our weekly tasks, and hold a larger meeting every week to assign new tasks and deal with merging on our repository hosted on Github (using Github Desktop).
