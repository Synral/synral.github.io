>Earth's Light is a cooperative action-adventure game following the story of four animals and their journey to save their ecosystems, protect their homes, and heal the planet. Fight off garbage monsters plaguing the wetlands, the invasive plants enrapturing the forest, water spirits flooding the plains, and the mechanical chipper robots destroying the arctic.

A project in collaboration with the Toronto Zoo as a member of Sedna Games, a group of students from Ontario Tech University. Features two complete levels (Wetlands and Arctic) and functions as a prototype proof of design developed over a year (09/2020 ~ 09/2021).

Over the course of the project, I was in charge of the gameplay mechanics
